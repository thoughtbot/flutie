# Flutie [![Build Status][ci-image]][ci] [![Gem Version][version-image]][version]

Flutie provides some utility view helpers for use with Rails applications.

There are helpers for setting a page title and for generating body classes.

## Installation & Upgrading

Flutie is a Railtie. We support the versions of Ruby and Rails listed in
[.github/workflows/build.yml](.github/workflows/build.yml).

It should be run as a gem and included in your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "flutie"
```

## Helpers

Flutie provides helper methods for use within Rails layouts and views.

### Page Title

The `page_title` method can be used like:

```erb
<title><%= page_title %></title>
```

By default, it will produce results like:

```html
<title>Appname : page title</title>
```

* "App name" comes from the module name of the rails application created by your
  app, i.e. `Appname::Application` will produce "Appname"
* "page" comes from trying `content_for(:page_title)` and assumes you are using
  `content_for` with `:page_title` symbol on your pages.
* The separator defaults to " : "

These can be overridden by passing an options hash including `:app_name`,
`:page_title_symbol` and `:separator` hash keys. For example:

```ruby
content_for(:site_page_title, 'My title of my page')
page_title(app_name: 'My app name', page_title_symbol: :site_page_title, separator: " | ")
```

would produce:

```html
<title>My app name | My title of my page</title>
```

You can also reverse the position of the `:app_name` and the `:site_page_title`
values by using the `:reverse` option. For example:

```ruby
content_for(:site_page_title, 'My title of my page')
page_title(app_name: 'My app name', page_title_symbol: :site_page_title, reverse: true)
```

would produce:

```html
<title>My title of my page : My app name</title>
```

### Body Class

The `body_class` method can be used like this in a layout:

```erb
<body class="<%= body_class %>">
```

This will produce a string including the controller name and controller-action
name pair.  For example, The `WidgetsController#show` action would produce:

```html
<body class="widgets widgets-show">
```

Anything which has been added via `content_for(:extra_body_classes)` will be
added to the end, for example views like:

```erb
content_for(:extra_body_classes, 'special-page')
<body class="<%= body_class %>">
```

would produce:

```html
<body class="widgets widgets-show special-page">
```
